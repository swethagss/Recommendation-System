# *Recommendation System*

This repository contains implementations of basic recommendation systems using different approaches, including Nearest Neighbors and Market Basket Analysis. 
These techniques are widely used to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing user preferences, similarities, and association patterns.

Introduction

Recommendation systems are an essential component of many applications, enabling personalized user experiences. In this repository, we explore three common recommendation techniques:

Basic Recommendation System:
This method is a simple approach to recommendation, often based on popularity or item-user interactions.
Nearest Neighbors-Based Recommendation System:
Using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm, this method provides recommendations by finding similarities between items or users, helping suggest items that are similar to what a user has previously interacted with.
Market Basket Analysis:
This approach uses association rules (such as Apriori algorithm) to analyze co-occurrences in user behavior, often used for cross-selling products by finding which items are frequently bought together.
